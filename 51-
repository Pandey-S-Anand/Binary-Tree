         * it indicates that one of the nodes (p or q) has been found in that subtree.
         * We then propagate that non-null node upward to the parent call to continue
         * the search for the LCA.
         *
         * Suppose you are at a node N in the tree, and you find p in the left subtree
         * of N. Then, q must be in one of three places:
         *
         * 1. In the right subtree of N:
         * - If q is in the right subtree of N, then N is the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
         *   of p and q. This is because N is the deepest node that has both p (in its left subtree)
         *   and q (in its right subtree) as descendants.
         *
         * 2. Above N in the tree:
         * - If q is not in the right subtree of N, it must be somewhere above N in the tree.
         *   This means the LCA of p and q is an ancestor of N.
         *
         * 3. q is a descendant of p:
         * - In this case, p itself is the LCA.
         *   Since q is already a descendant of p, p will be the deepest node that has both p and q as descendants.
         *
         *   The LCA is the deepest node that has both p and q as descendants.
         *
         *   This is why the algorithm stops searching further down the branch once it
         *   finds p or q and backtracks to find the LCA.
         *
         * For example, consider the tree:
         *    3
         *   / \
         *  5   1
         * / \
         * 6  2
         *   / \
         *  7   4
         *
         * In scenarios where one node is an ancestor of the other (e.g., p = 5 and q = 4),
         * the non-null value that is propagated upward (node 5) correctly serves as the LCA.
